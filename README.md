## Credits

This project was originally forked from [Perplexica](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica), an open-source AI search engine. We've adapted and expanded upon their work to create a specialized tool for the Starknet ecosystem. We're grateful for their initial contribution which provided a strong foundation for Perplexica.

## Overview

Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool specifically designed for the Starknet Ecosystem. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms to search and understand the Starknet documentation and the Cairo Book, providing clear and accurate answers to your queries about Starknet and Cairo.

## Features

- **Local LLMs**: You can make use of local LLMs such as Llama3 and Mixtral using Ollama.
- **Focus Modes:** Special modes to better answer specific types of questions. Perplexica currently has 2 focus modes:
  - **Cairo Book:** Searches the [Cairo Book](https://book.cairo-lang.org) for answers.
  - **Starknet Docs:** Searches the [Starknet documentation](https://docs.starknet.io) for answers.

## Installation

There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.

### Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
2. Clone the Perplexica repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/enitrat/Perplexica.git
   ```

3. After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.

4. Rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml`. For Docker setups, you need only fill in the following fields:

   - `OPENAI`: Your OpenAI API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use OpenAI's models**.
   - `OLLAMA`: Your Ollama API URL. You should enter it as `http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER`. If you installed Ollama on port 11434, use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`. For other ports, adjust accordingly. **You need to fill this if you wish to use Ollama's models instead of OpenAI's**.
   - `GROQ`: Your Groq API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Groq's hosted models**.
   - `ANTHROPIC`: Your Anthropic API key. **You only need to fill this if you wish to use Anthropic models**.

     **Note**: You can change these after starting Perplexica from the settings dialog.

   - `SIMILARITY_MEASURE`: The similarity measure to use (This is filled by default; you can leave it as is if you are unsure about it.)

5. Ensure you are in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yaml` file and execute:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5bis. Alternatively, you can start the containers in dev mode, with hot reloading, by running:

```bash
docker compose up -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

6. Wait a few minutes for the setup to complete. You can access Perplexica at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

**Note**: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.

### Non-Docker Installation

1. Install SearXNG and allow `JSON` format in the SearXNG settings.
2. Clone the repository and rename the `sample.config.toml` file to `config.toml` in the root directory. Ensure you complete all required fields in this file.
3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the `ui` folder and fill in all necessary fields.
4. After populating the configuration and environment files, run `npm i` in both the `ui` folder and the root directory.
5. Install the dependencies and then execute `npm run build` in both the `ui` folder and the root directory.
6. Finally, start both the frontend and the backend by running `npm run start` in both the `ui` folder and the root directory.

**Note**: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.

See the [installation documentation](https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica/tree/master/docs/installation) for more information like exposing it your network, etc.

### Ollama Connection Errors

If you're encountering an Ollama connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Ollama's API. To fix this issue you can:

1. **Check your Ollama API URL:** Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.
2. **Update API URL Based on OS:**

   - **Windows:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Mac:** Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
   - **Linux:** Use `http://<private_ip_of_host>:11434`

   Adjust the port number if you're using a different one.

3. **Linux Users - Expose Ollama to Network:**

   - Inside `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service`, you need to add `Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0"`. Then restart Ollama by `systemctl restart ollama`. For more information see [Ollama docs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#setting-environment-variables-on-linux)

   - Ensure that the port (default is 11434) is not blocked by your firewall.

## Using as a Search Engine

If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser's search bar, follow these steps:

1. Open your browser's settings.
2. Navigate to the 'Search Engines' section.
3. Add a new site search with the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/?q=%s`. Replace `localhost` with your IP address or domain name, and `3000` with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.
4. Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser's search bar.
